## Hello World!

No Bullshit Software, NBSS for short (and profanity-avoiding) is a nonprofit company focused on making software that follows 3 principles
  1. It's made for the user, not the shareholders
  2. It's open, code should belong to everyone
  3. It makes no bs decisions and values user choice & privacy
